Meeting you has been the best thing that's ever happened in my life, and choosing to love you has been the best decision I've ever made. Always remember that you have me even in your ups and downs. I will never get tired of loving you.

Thank you for loving me and accepting who I am, and for showing me my worth

for listening to all my yaps, for everything that you do

for me, and I will always be thankful that I have you in my life.

Don't ever forget that I'm always on your side, I'll always pray for your happiness and success in achieving your goals in life.

You make my world a better place, my love for you grows every day. I love you so much.
